# Uncommon HTML Bug: Missing Closing Tag in Nested Elements

This repository demonstrates a subtle yet impactful HTML bug: a missing closing tag in nested elements.  While common errors involve mismatched tags, this example highlights how an omission within nested structures can affect rendering unpredictably.

The `bug.html` file showcases the error.  The `bugSolution.html` file provides the corrected code.

This bug is particularly tricky to debug because browsers sometimes try to "recover" from the error, leading to seemingly random layout inconsistencies.  Properly nested elements are crucial for consistent and predictable HTML rendering.
